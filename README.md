# Just AI Test Assignment: FOV Calculator for Racing Simulators

This repository is created for the Just AI test assignment and contains the code for a chatbot that calculates the Field of View (FOV) for racing simulators.

## Description

The chatbot asks the user for their display parameters and calculates the optimal FOV values for setting up in a racing simulator.

## Functionality

1. Asks the user for display parameters:
    - Monitor diagonal (in centimeters)
    - Aspect ratio
    - Distance from eyes to screen (in centimeters)
2. Calculates the optimal FOV value for the racing simulator.
3. Returns the calculated FOV value to the user.

## Usage Example

```plaintext
Bot: Hi there! Let's calculate your FOV for the racing simulator. First, let's determine your screen's aspect ratio. Choose from the list.
User: 16:9
Bot: Great, now grab a tape measure and measure the diagonal of the visible screen area (excluding the bezel).
User: 68.6 cm
Bot: Awesome, now sit in your driving position and measure the distance from your eyes to the monitor.
User: 80 cm
Bot: For your setup, the correct FOV to set is: 59 degrees.
```
